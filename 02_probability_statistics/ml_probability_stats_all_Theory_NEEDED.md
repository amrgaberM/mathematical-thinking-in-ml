## Basic Probability

### Fundamental Concepts

**Probability** measures the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).

**Sample Space (Ω)**: The set of all possible outcomes
**Event (E)**: A subset of the sample space
**Probability of Event**: P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes

### Key Probability Rules

1. **Addition Rule**: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
2. **Multiplication Rule**: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)
3. **Complement Rule**: P(A') = 1 - P(A)

### Conditional Probability

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

This is fundamental in ML for understanding how features influence predictions.

### Independence

Events A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A), which means P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B).

In ML, feature independence is a key assumption in many algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes).

### Bayes' Theorem

P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)

This is the foundation of Bayesian machine learning and forms the basis for many probabilistic models.

**ML Application**: In classification, we often want P(class|features) = P(features|class) × P(class) / P(features)

## Probability Distributions

### Discrete Distributions

#### Bernoulli Distribution
- Models a single binary trial (success/failure)

- **ML Use**: Binary classification, coin flip models

#### Binomial Distribution
- Number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials

#### Normal (Gaussian) Distribution
- Bell-shaped curve, most important distribution in ML
