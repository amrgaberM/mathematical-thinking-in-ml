# Probability and Statistics

This section focuses on the mathematical principles of probability and statistics used in modeling uncertainty, analyzing data, and evaluating machine learning results.

## Topics Covered

- Probability fundamentals and axioms
- Conditional probability and Bayesâ€™ Theorem
- Probability distributions (discrete and continuous)
  - Binomial and Beta distributions
  - Normal distribution and Z-scores
  - Inverse cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
- Expected value and variance
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std. dev)
- Inferential statistics
  - Confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis testing
  - p-values and significance
  - The t-distribution

## Goal

To build a practical understanding of probability and statistical reasoning for use in modeling, inference, evaluation, and uncertainty quantification in machine learning workflows.
