# Mathematical Thinking in Machine Learning

This repository documents a structured learning journey that bridges core mathematical concepts with practical machine learning applications. The goal is to demonstrate strong theoretical understanding, applied reasoning, and engineering-ready implementations.

This work is aligned with the skill set expected from ML Engineers and candidates applying to programs like the ITI AI/ML track.

## Repository Structure

- `01_math_fundamentals/`  
  Foundational topics such as sets, functions, exponents, and calculus concepts relevant to learning rates and optimization.

- `02_probability_statistics/`  
  Covers descriptive statistics, probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, and statistical inference.

- `03_linear_algebra/`  
  Focuses on vectors, matrices, transformations, eigenvalues, and their applications in machine learning models.

- `04_ml_math_applied/`  
  Math behind ML algorithms: gradient descent, cost functions, regularization, linear/logistic regression, and model evaluation.

- `05_applied_projects/`  
  Real-world projects applying the above knowledge: data analysis, model building from scratch, deployment (Streamlit, AWS), and case studies.

## Objectives

- Build a clear understanding of the mathematical foundations used in ML engineering.
- Translate math concepts directly into code and real-world machine learning workflows.
- Create a high-quality, transparent, and practical portfolio to support academic and job applications.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, Streamlit
- AWS services (in deployment notebooks)

---

## Approach

- Each notebook is designed to be concise, visual, and practical.
- Topics are learned in sequence and reinforced through implementation.
- Concepts from math and ML are linked directly rather than studied in isolation.

---

## Audience

- Machine Learning Engineer candidates
- Students preparing for AI/ML programs (e.g., ITI)
- Self-learners building a structured ML foundation
