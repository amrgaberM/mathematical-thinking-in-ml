# Math Fundamentals

This section introduces essential mathematical foundations for machine learning. It includes both pre-calculus tools and core calculus concepts needed to understand optimization, continuous functions, and gradient-based methods.

## Topics Covered

- Exponents and logarithms
- Eulerâ€™s number and natural logarithms
- Summation notation
- Limits and continuity
- Derivatives and differentiation rules
- Partial derivatives and the chain rule
- Integrals and area under curves

## Goal

To build a solid understanding of how calculus enables key ML techniques such as gradient descent, backpropagation, and continuous cost functions.
