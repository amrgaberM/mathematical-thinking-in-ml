# Applied Machine Learning Projects

This section contains end-to-end machine learning projects that demonstrate the practical application of mathematical concepts in real scenarios. Each project is designed to highlight specific math-driven insights, modeling techniques, and implementation skills.

## Project Objectives

- Translate math foundations into working ML models
- Apply statistics, calculus, and linear algebra in real datasets
- Demonstrate problem-solving, coding, and data storytelling
- Create clean, reproducible, and well-documented work

## Project Examples

> *Note: Projects will be added progressively.*

- **Linear Regression from Scratch**  
  Using matrix operations and gradient descent on real-world data.

- **Classification with Logistic Regression**  
  Implementing the sigmoid function, log-loss, and backpropagation.

- **PCA and Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Applying eigen decomposition and visualizing principal components.

- **Probability-Based Risk Scoring**  
  Using distributions and statistical thresholds for decision-making.

- **Model Evaluation and Metrics**  
  Building confusion matrices, ROC/AUC curves, and optimizing thresholds.

## Project Format

Each notebook includes:
- Problem statement and objective
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model implementation (from scratch or using libraries)
- Mathematical explanation of the techniques used
- Visualizations and performance evaluation
- Clean, modular code with comments

## Goal

To showcase a practical understanding of machine learning through mathematically grounded projects. These projects reflect an engineering-first mindset and readiness for real-world ML work.
