## 1. Introduction to Probability

**Probability** is a numerical measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It serves as the mathematical foundation for reasoning under uncertainty, which is essential in machine learning where we constantly deal with noisy data and unpredictable outcomes.

### The Probability Scale

Probability values range from 0 to 1:
- **0** means the event is impossible (will never occur)
- **0.5** means the event is equally likely to occur or not occur  
- **1** means the event is certain (will always occur)

For example, the probability of rolling a 7 with a standard six-sided die is 0 (impossible), while the probability of getting heads or tails when flipping a fair coin is 1 (certain).

### Why Probability Matters in Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms make predictions based on patterns in data, but these predictions are inherently uncertain. Probability helps us:
- Quantify our confidence in predictions
- Handle noisy and incomplete data
- Make optimal decisions under uncertainty
- Evaluate model performance

## 2. Core Terminology

Understanding these fundamental terms is crucial for working with probability:

| Term | Definition | Example | ML Context |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Experiment** | A process or action with uncertain outcome | Tossing a coin | Training a model on new data |
| **Outcome** | A possible result of an experiment | "Heads" | Correct or incorrect prediction |
| **Event** | A specific set of outcomes | Getting "Heads" | Model accuracy exceeding 90% |
| **Sample Space** | All possible outcomes of the experiment | {Heads, Tails} | All possible model predictions |

### Real-World Example: Email Classification

Consider building a spam filter:
- **Experiment**: Classifying an incoming email  
- **Outcomes**: "Spam" or "Not Spam"
- **Event**: Email being classified as "Spam"
- **Sample Space**: {"Spam", "Not Spam"}

---

## 3. Fundamental Probability Rules

These four rules form the foundation of probability theory:

### Rule 1: Total Probability (Normalization)

The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1:

```
∑ P(xi) = 1
```

**Example**: For a fair coin, P(Heads) + P(Tails) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1

This rule ensures that something must happen - one of the possible outcomes will occur.

### Rule 2: Classical Probability Formula

The probability of an event equals the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:

```
P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
```

**Example with dice**: 
- P(rolling an even number) = 3 favorable outcomes {2, 4, 6} / 6 total outcomes = 0.5
- P(rolling a specific number like 6) = 1 favorable outcome / 6 total outcomes ≈ 0.167

### Rule 3: Addition Rule (Mutually Exclusive Events)

When events cannot happen simultaneously:

```
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
```

**Example**: Drawing cards from a deck
- P(drawing a King OR a Queen) = P(King) + P(Queen) = 4/52 + 4/52 = 8/52 ≈ 0.154

### Rule 4: Multiplication Rule (Independent Events)

When one event doesn't influence another:

```
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
```

**Example**: Two independent coin flips
- P(Heads on first flip AND Heads on second flip) = 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25

---

## 4. Conditional Probability

Conditional probability describes the likelihood of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred:

```
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
```

This reads as "the probability of A given B."

### Medical Diagnosis Example

Consider medical testing:
- **A**: Patient has the disease
- **B**: Test result is positive  
- **P(A|B)**: Probability patient has disease given positive test result

This is different from P(A), which is the general probability of having the disease without any test information.

### Applications in Machine Learning

- **Text Classification**: P(Email is spam | contains word "lottery")
- **Recommendation Systems**: P(User likes movie | user's demographic and viewing history)
- **Computer Vision**: P(Object is a cat | image contains whiskers and pointy ears)

---

## 5. Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem is one of the most important concepts in probability and machine learning:

```
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)
```

### Understanding the Components

- **P(A|B)** - **Posterior**: What we want to find (probability of A given evidence B)
- **P(B|A)** - **Likelihood**: How probable is the evidence given our hypothesis
- **P(A)** - **Prior**: Our initial belief about A before seeing evidence
- **P(B)** - **Evidence**: Total probability of observing the evidence

### Detailed Medical Testing Example

**Scenario**: Testing for a rare disease affecting 1% of the population
- Test accuracy: 99% (correctly identifies 99% of actual cases)
- False positive rate: 5% (incorrectly flags 5% of healthy people as positive)

**Question**: If you test positive, what's the probability you actually have the disease?

**Intuitive answer**: Many people might guess 99%, but let's calculate:

```python
# Given information
P_disease = 0.01           # 1% of population has disease
P_test_pos_given_disease = 0.99    # 99% accuracy for detecting disease
P_test_pos_given_healthy = 0.05    # 5% false positive rate

# Calculate P(test positive) using law of total probability
P_test_positive = (P_test_pos_given_disease * P_disease) + 
                  (P_test_pos_given_healthy * (1 - P_disease))
                = (0.99 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99)
                = 0.0099 + 0.0495 = 0.0594

# Apply Bayes' theorem
P_disease_given_positive = (P_test_pos_given_disease * P_disease) / P_test_positive
                         = (0.99 * 0.01) / 0.0594
                         = 0.0099 / 0.0594 ≈ 0.167
```

**Surprising result**: Even with a positive test, there's only about a 16.7% chance of actually having the disease! This demonstrates the importance of considering base rates (prior probabilities).

### Core Applications in Machine Learning

- **Naive Bayes classifiers**: Direct application for text classification and spam filtering
- **Bayesian networks**: Modeling complex probabilistic relationships
- **A/B testing**: Updating beliefs about which version performs better
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Bayesian optimization for finding optimal parameters

## 6. Applications in Machine Learning

Probability appears throughout machine learning in various forms:

### Classification Algorithms

| Algorithm | Probabilistic Interpretation | Example Usage |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | Outputs class probabilities using sigmoid function | Binary classification, odds ratios |
| **Naive Bayes** | Applies Bayes' theorem with feature independence assumption | Text classification, spam filtering |
| **Random Forest** | Averages probabilistic predictions from multiple trees | Feature importance, uncertainty estimation |
| **Neural Networks** | Softmax layer converts outputs to probability distributions | Multi-class classification |

### Regularization Techniques

- **Dropout**: Randomly sets neurons to zero with probability p during training
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies random transformations with specified probabilities
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Uses random mini-batches for parameter updates

### Evaluation Metrics

Common metrics are fundamentally probabilistic:
- **Precision**: P(Actually positive | Predicted positive)
- **Recall**: P(Predicted positive | Actually positive)  
- **Specificity**: P(Predicted negative | Actually negative)

### Advanced Applications

- **Bayesian Deep Learning**: Treats neural network weights as probability distributions
- **Gaussian Processes**: Models functions as probability distributions
- **Variational Autoencoders**: Uses probabilistic encoding and decoding
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy gradients use probability distributions over actions

## 7. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Logistic Regression for Iris Classification

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Load the famous iris dataset
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get class probabilities for test set
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Display results for first 5 samples
print("Sample predictions with probabilities:")
print("Format: [P(setosa), P(versicolor), P(virginica)]")
for i in range(5):
    pred_class = model.classes_[np.argmax(probabilities[i])]
    confidence = np.max(probabilities[i])
    print(f"Sample {i+1}: {probabilities[i].round(3)} -> Predicted: {pred_class} (confidence: {confidence:.1%})")

# Example output:
# Sample 1: [0.898 0.102 0.000] -> Predicted: setosa (confidence: 89.8%)
# Sample 2: [0.000 0.789 0.211] -> Predicted: versicolor (confidence: 78.9%)
```

### Example 2: Naive Bayes for Text Classification

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Sample email data
emails = [
    "Win money now! Click here for amazing deals!",
    "Meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm",
    "Congratulations! You've won a million dollars!",
    "Please review the attached document",
    "Free lottery tickets! Act now!"
]

labels = ["spam", "ham", "spam", "ham", "spam"]

# Create pipeline with text processing and Naive Bayes
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB())
])

# Train the model
pipeline.fit(emails, labels)

# Test on new emails
test_emails = [
    "Important meeting update",
    "Claim your prize now!"
]

# Get predictions and probabilities
for email in test_emails:
    prediction = pipeline.predict([email])[0]
    probabilities = pipeline.predict_proba([email])[0]
    
    print(f"Email: '{email}'")
    print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
    print(f"P(ham): {probabilities[0]:.3f}, P(spam): {probabilities[1]:.3f}")
    print()
```

### Example 3: Bayesian Thinking in A/B Testing

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# A/B test scenario: comparing two website designs
# Version A: 120 conversions out of 1000 visitors
# Version B: 140 conversions out of 1000 visitors

def bayesian_ab_test(conversions_a, visitors_a, conversions_b, visitors_b):
    """
    Perform Bayesian A/B test using Beta-Binomial model
    """
    # Using uniform prior (Beta(1,1))
    alpha_prior, beta_prior = 1, 1
    
    # Posterior distributions
    alpha_a = alpha_prior + conversions_a
    beta_a = beta_prior + visitors_a - conversions_a
    
    alpha_b = alpha_prior + conversions_b
    beta_b = beta_prior + visitors_b - conversions_b
    
    # Sample from posterior distributions
    samples_a = np.random.beta(alpha_a, beta_a, 10000)
    samples_b = np.random.beta(alpha_b, beta_b, 10000)
    
    # Probability that B is better than A
    prob_b_better = np.mean(samples_b > samples_a)
    
    return {
        'conversion_rate_a': conversions_a / visitors_a,
        'conversion_rate_b': conversions_b / visitors_b,
        'prob_b_better_than_a': prob_b_better,
        'confidence_interval_a': np.percentile(samples_a, [2.5, 97.5]),
        'confidence_interval_b': np.percentile(samples_b, [2.5, 97.5])
    }

# Run the test
results = bayesian_ab_test(120, 1000, 140, 1000)

print("A/B Test Results:")
print(f"Version A conversion rate: {results['conversion_rate_a']:.1%}")
print(f"Version B conversion rate: {results['conversion_rate_b']:.1%}")
print(f"Probability B is better than A: {results['prob_b_better_than_a']:.1%}")
print(f"95% CI for A: [{results['confidence_interval_a'][0]:.3f}, {results['confidence_interval_a'][1]:.3f}]")
print(f"95% CI for B: [{results['confidence_interval_b'][0]:.3f}, {results['confidence_interval_b'][1]:.3f}]")
```

## 8. Advanced Topics

### Joint and Marginal Probability

When dealing with multiple variables:
- **Joint probability**: P(A and B) - probability both events occur
- **Marginal probability**: P(A) - probability of A regardless of other events

### Law of Total Probability

For any event A and a set of mutually exclusive events B₁, B₂, ..., Bₙ:

```
P(A) = P(A|B₁)P(B₁) + P(A|B₂)P(B₂) + ... + P(A|Bₙ)P(Bₙ)
```

This is essential for calculating complex probabilities and is used extensively in Bayesian inference.

### Common Probability Distributions in ML

- **Bernoulli**: Binary outcomes (success/failure)
- **Binomial**: Number of successes in n trials
- **Normal (Gaussian)**: Continuous variables, central limit theorem
- **Poisson**: Count data, rare events
- **Beta**: Probability of probabilities (useful for Bayesian analysis)

### Information Theory Connections

Probability connects to information theory through concepts like:
- **Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty in a probability distribution
- **Cross-entropy**: Used as loss function in classification
- **KL divergence**: Measure of difference between probability distributions
